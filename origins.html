                    In June 1967, tensions between Israel and neighboring Arab countries reached a boiling point. On June 5th, Israel launched a preemptive strike against Egypt, marking the beginning of what became known as the Six-Day War. In less than a week, Israel achieved a stunning military victory against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, gaining control of the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights.

                    The war dramatically altered the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. It solidified Israel’s military reputation, reshaped borders, and left a deep impact on regional politics and the global Jewish community. Despite its brevity, the war's effects continue to reverberate in modern conflicts and diplomacy.

                   During the war, Israeli jets mistakenly attacked the USS Liberty, an American naval intelligence ship, killing 34 crew members. Israel later apologized, calling it a tragic error, but controversy still surrounds the incident.
